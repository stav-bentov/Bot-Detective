# Datasets

You can find several datasets of classified users. For our model training, we used four of them: cresci-17, celebrity, botometer-feedback and political-bots. 
The `all_df.csv` dataset is a combined dataset that comprises all of them, containing 11,094 users classified as human and 9,772 as bots.
